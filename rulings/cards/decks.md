# Decks

**Decks** are collections of cards arranged in a stack. Each player has a [**core deck**](#Core-Deck) and a [**super deck**](#Super-Deck).

‘Deck’ also refers to the overall package of the core and super decks, meaning the particular cards a player has chosen to play with. For instance, a ‘dragon deck’ refers to a core and super deck built with a strategy revolving around dragon spirits.

You can only include a maximum of **3** copies of a card with a particular name in a deck, regardless of their level. Some more powerful cards may impose additional restrictions, limiting the maximum copies to 2 or 1.

## Core Deck

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"> cards </th>
    <td> ~50 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"> card varieties </th>
    <td> standard spirits </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The core deck is where most of the cards you play with reside. It is shuffled at the start of each duel. Cards are **drawn** from here, whether at the start of the duel, at the start of a turn, or by card effect.

It is placed face-down in the lower right corner of the player’s side of the arena.

## Super Deck

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"> cards </th>
    <td> ~10 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"> card varieties </th>
    <td> super spirits </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The super deck stores [super spirits](super-spirits.md) that can be spawned whenever their requirements have been met. Since cards are never drawn from here, the order of cards is irrelevant, so they can be ordered however the player wishes. The player can check the contents of their super deck at any time.
